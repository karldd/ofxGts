ofxGts
---------------------------------

An early stage implementation of the GNU Triangulated Surface Library as an openFrameworks addon. GTS provides a set of useful functions to deal with 3D surfaces meshed with interconnected triangles.

http://gts.sourceforge.net/

GTS has been compiled on mac and includes its static libraries and associated dependencies such as glib. Windows/linux users will have to compile GTS and add it to the libs/gts/lib/ directory. This add-on has been tested with OF 006.2.

If you want to set this up in Xcode (rather than work from the example), add the following to your header search paths and make it a recursive search:
../../../addons/ofxGts/libs/gts/include/
